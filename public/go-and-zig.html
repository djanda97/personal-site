    <p>Go and Zig can be characterized as spritual successors to C due to having a minimal amount of keywords and
        concepts, allowing the constructs of the language to stay out of the developer's way so that they can focus on
        writing application logic. While there are use cases why someone would want to use a programming language that
        offers more advanced features (e.g. Rust, C++, Haskell), the purpose of this post is to compare the following
        topics between Go and Zig:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory Management</li>
        <li>Concurrency</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <li>Interoperability with C</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Memory Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go: Garbage collection</li>
        <li>Zig: Manual memory management, custom allocators</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Concurrency</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go: Builtin primitives for concurrency, "go" keyword, channels</li>
        <li>Zig: TODO</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go: TODO</li>
        <li>Zig: TODO</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interoperability with C</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go: Cgo</li>
        <li>Zig: "translate-c" command, Namespaced C code using builtin functions such as "@cImport", "@cInclude", and
            "@cDefine"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go: Interfaces - Any struct that has all methods declared in an interface implicity satifies the interface
        </li>
        <li>Zig: Comptime - Alternative to macros, can be used for generic programming, build system</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Similarities</h3>
    <p>TODO</p>
