    <h3>Jotting down a few reasons why I decided to start this site</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To act as a journal to catalog my thoughts as I gain exposure to different programming languages and computing topics</li>
        <li>To act as a creative outlet from both a technical perspective as well as an artistic one</li>
        <li>To act as a canvas for practing web design skills</li>
        <li>To act as a simple content management system for organizing various media that I consume, whether it be films, books, games, or music</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>List of programming languages that I want to learn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Backend/Server: Go - via completing exercises from <a href="https://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming Language</a> book by Alan Donovan & Brian Kernighan</li>
        <li>Systems: Zig - via completing exercises from the <a href="https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings">Ziglings</a> course</li>
        <li>Frontend/UI: Elm - via completing exercises from the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action">Elm In Action</a> book by Richard Feldman</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I intend to write posts about each of these topics as I work through the exercises mentioned above. Another avenue to pursue to become more familiar with these programming languages would be to contribute to open source projects.</p>
